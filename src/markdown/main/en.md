## Hey there!

<br>

Glad to see you on my page!

<br>

My name is Valerii, and I've been working as a software engineer since 2015.
I was born in Kyrgyzstan in 1989 and lived in Bishkek for 28 years before moving to Belarus. I currently live in Minsk.

<br>

Since childhood, I've loved computer games and dreamed of getting into game dev. But my dream turned out to be not as rosy as I imagined it in my youth.
So I continue developing software, but I decided to return to where I started my career in programming.
Right now, I'm focused on web development — and I'm not so bad at it :)

<br>

I also help people start their careers as software engineers. Mentoring isn't my main activity, but rather a hobby that helps me learn and meet new people. It's always fun!
