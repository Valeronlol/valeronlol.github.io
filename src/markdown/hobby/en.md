## Threre you can find more about me and what I like in life.
<br>

While studying at school, math were very easy for me, so my parents decided that I should be an engineer and sent me to the engineering institute of BGTU "Voenmeh".
I studied engineering for three years, and then I realized that this is not what I would like. I decided to transfer to the opposite specialty, the Faculty of Management in "Tourism and Services".

<br>

So, I am a certified manager.
Yep, this is weird.

But years later I returned to engineering, but as a software engineer.

<br>

During my student days, I was actively involved in sports and even have a achievements in powerlifting, but this is in the past. Now I go in for sports just for the sake of health.

But I still remember how to bench press correctly. :)

<br>

I will not hide the fact that I really love cats! I left my cat to my mother when I moved to Minsk. Now she has three cats! But, I plan to have a cat here too. Perhaps when you read this text, I already have a big and fat cat!

<br>

In the past I was a professional massage therapist with more year of experience. I also worked as a bartender, manager, seller, and even opened a travel company and led tours in the mountains in the Issyk-Kul region of Kyrgyzstan.

<br>

In my free time I make sports, waste time on YouTube, and also study random technologies. I don’t think it’s very helpful, but almost always it’s fun.
I managed to superficially study such languages as C/C++, C#, Java, Golang. But professionally I had to write in Javascript, Python, PHP.

<br>

This site was made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/), along the way studying these technologies.

<br>

The Rust language is very interesting for me now. It is on target, useful topics are collecting.
I suppose that my main stack is: Vue/React and Node.js for now

I am currently studying AWS, Kubernetes and Cloud technologies.

<br>

I am interested in the topic of startups, especially streaming platforms and everything related to games and entertainment. But I do not accept betting and gambling and so on.

Inspires the NFT model in the game industry.

<br>

Sometimes I write about technologies, if you are interested in what exactly, then you can find a link to my page on "medium" on social networks.

<br>

Also, I like good tea, chocolate, snowboarding, trekking and sauna. And, of course, computer games, from time to time I play "Civilization 6", "Factorio".

<br>

But, my main achievement in life is deployed microk8s cluster on a home Raspberry Pi 4 with bunch of pet projects :)
