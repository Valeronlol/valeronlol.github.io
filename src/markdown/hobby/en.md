## Here you can find more about me and what I like in life.

<br>

When I was in school, math came very easy to me, so my parents decided I should be an engineer and sent me to the engineering institute of BGTU "Voenmeh".
I studied engineering for three years before realizing it wasn't what I wanted. So I transferred to the opposite specialty — the Faculty of Management in "Tourism and Services".

<br>

So yes, I'm a certified manager.
Yep, this is weird.

But years later, I returned to engineering — as a software engineer.

<br>

During my student days, I was actively involved in sports and even have achievements in powerlifting. But that's in the past. Now I exercise just for the sake of health.

But I still remember how to bench press correctly. :)

<br>

I won't hide the fact that I really love cats! I left my cat with my mother when I moved to Minsk. Now she has three cats! But I plan to have a cat here too. Perhaps when you read this, I already have a big, fat cat!

<br>

In the past, I was a professional massage therapist with over a year of experience. I also worked as a bartender, manager, seller, and even opened a travel company, leading tours in the mountains of the Issyk-Kul region in Kyrgyzstan.

<br>

In my free time, I exercise, waste time on YouTube, and study random technologies. I don't think it's very helpful, but it's almost always fun.
I've managed to superficially study languages like C/C++, C#, Java, and PHP. But professionally, I've had to write in JavaScript, Python, and Golang.

<br>

This site was made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/), while studying these technologies along the way.

<br>

Right now, I'm very interested in the Rust language. It's on my radar, and I'm collecting useful resources.
I consider my main stack to be Vue/React and Node.js for now.

I'm currently studying AWS, Kubernetes, and Cloud technologies.

<br>

I'm interested in startups, especially streaming platforms and everything related to games and entertainment. But I don't accept betting, gambling, and similar things.

The NFT model in the game industry inspires me.

<br>

Sometimes I write about technologies. If you're interested in what exactly, you can find a link to my Medium page in the social networks section.

<br>

Also, I like good tea, chocolate, snowboarding, trekking, and sauna. And of course, computer games — from time to time I play "Civilization 6" and "Factorio", "Workers &  Resourses", "Victoria 3".

<br>

But my main achievement in life is a deployed microk8s cluster on a home Raspberry Pi 4 with a bunch of pet projects :)
